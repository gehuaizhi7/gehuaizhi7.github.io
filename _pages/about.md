My name is Huaizhi Ge. I hold a master's degree in Data Science from Columbia University and a bachelor's from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests center on advancing the trustworthiness, robustness, and capabilities of AI systems while deepening our understanding of their core mechanisms through interpretability techniques.
